# Gallery View

This is part of my larger blog app, and is missing the base that would include JS and style and represent the structure

It relies on the following:

1. in the static folder (see settings.py for definition) there must be a galleries folder; this is where you'll drop folders representing each gallery
2. Images must be JPG (this is assumed for simplicity); at some point I will expand this to allow for GIFs and PNGs as well
